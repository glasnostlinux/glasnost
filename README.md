# [Glasnost Linux](https://www.glasnost.org) Main Repo

This repository contains the build files for Glasnost. These can be run on any of the currently supported architectures:
 - aarch64
 - powerpc64
 - powerpc64le
 - x86_64
 
chroot tarballs are provided for each architecture [here](https://github.com/glasnostlinux/glasnost/releases).

Installation should be treated similar to [KISS Linux](https://k1ss.org/install). Specific install instructions will be added here and at [glasnost.org](https://www.glasnost.org)

See [glasnost.org](https://www.glasnost.org) for more information.

### Thanks to:
 - [Dylan Araps](https://github.com/dylanaraps) for creating [KISS Linux](https://k1ss.org). Glasnost uses the KISS package manager and package repositories.
 - [M. Herdiansyah](https://github.com/konimex) for creating the [kiss-llvm](https://github.com/konimex/kiss-llvm) bootstrap repo. This is what was used to bootstrap Glasnost.
