# Glasnost Linux Main Repo

This repository contains the build files for Glasnost. These can be run on any of the currently supported architectures:
 - aarch64
 - powerpc64
 - powerpc64le
 - x86_64
 
chroot tarballs are provided for each architecture [here](https://github.com/glasnostlinux/glasnost/releases).

Installation should be treated similar to [KISS Linux](https://k1ss.org/install). Specific install instructions will be added here and at [glasnost.org](https://glasnost.org)
